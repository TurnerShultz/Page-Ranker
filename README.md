# PageRank Project
This purpose of this project was to implement a simplified version of the original PageRank algorithm that Google was built on.

-input:
  1st line takes in number of command lines that will follow and number of power iterations that need to be performed
  Following lines are webpages and what other webpages they point to
  
  ex)
  7 2
  google.com gmail.com
  google.com maps.com
  facebook.com ufl.edu
  ufl.edu google.com
  ufl.edu gmail.com
  maps.com facebook.com
  gmail.com maps.com
  
-output:
  Each webpage along with it's PageRank based on the number of power iterations
  
  ex) 
  facebook.com 0.20
  gmail.com 0.20
  google.com 0.10
  maps.com 0.30
  ufl.edu 0.20
